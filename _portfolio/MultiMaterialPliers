Syringe pumps, also known as infusion pumps, offer a cost-effective solution for administering precise fluid doses to patients over extended periods, a task that would be costly and inefficient for human nurses. These pumps typically feature a syringe for fluid storage, a block to press the plunger, a lead screw to translate motor rotation into linear motion, a base for structural integrity, and tubing to deliver the fluid, ensuring consistent and controlled fluid delivery. This design incorporates similar components to provide the same functionality of stable and controlled pumping of fluid.
