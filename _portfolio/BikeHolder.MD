Top-down modeling is a design approach in CAD where the design process starts with the overall concept or high-level assembly, and then gradually adds more detail and complexity to the model. This method allows designers to focus on the bigger picture first, identify key features and relationships, and then refine the design by breaking it down into smaller, more manageable components. Top-down modeling is useful for complex products since it enables designers to quickly explore design alternatives and develop on the overall concept before delving into the smaller details. This approach can lead to more efficient and cohesive designs, as the relationships between different components are established early in the process.

## Design
For my design of the bike phone holder, I used the flexible material TPU to create a phone case using the dimensions of an iPhone 15 as well as the wrap-around piece. Using TPU allows for the phone case to mold around the phone and hold its place, and it also allows for the wrap around strap to be stretched to accommodate different sizes of handlebars. The phone can be rotated so that the display can be seen horizontally and vertically. The twisting mechanism is inside the circular piece. There is a smaller gear placed inside of the phone case made out of firm PLA, and the clearance between the inner and outer teeth of the two pieces allow for the phone to rotate easily and stay locked in place once it's in the desired position.
