Microfluidic devices are micro systems that allow for the manipulation of small volumes of fuids so they can be analyzed. A microfluidic device is like a circuit board for liquids qhere small channels and tubes transport, sort, and mix reagants together. Key features of a microfluidic device incluide: precise fluid control, low sample volumes, and fast analysis and processing. Pinch flow sorting is a microfluidic technique used to seperate particles or cells based on their size. This method may be used for cell sorting or particle seperation. Pinch flow sorting can be challenging due to the need to maintain consistent flow stability. The channels in the microfluidic design also need to created for different particle sizes in order to control their paths. The fabrication of these devices need to be precise as small changes in dimensions can impact sorting.

## Design

This device has two inlets and three outlets. The top outlet is a drain for the fluid, the middle outlet is for the larger particles, and the third outlet is for the smaller particles. One inlet is for the buffer solution and the second is for the particle mixture. The solution from both inlets flow into the device where they meet at a narrow channel. Once the particles are aligned on the side-wall under the flow of the buffer solution, they follow seperate streamlines according to their size. The pinched segment is split into the seperate outlets. Based on the particle diameter, they will either flow through the middle channel or to the bottom channel. The particle sizes used in this experiment were 165 micron and 550 micron (.165 mm and .55 mm). The initial channels were chosen to be 0.8mm to allow for easy flow of the particles with enough space to flow without clogging. The height of all channels were also 0.8 mm. For replication purposes, allow for 0.25 mm of clearance based on the larger particle diameter. The middle channel that the particles meet at and the larger particles continue to flow through maintains its width of .8 mm. The top drain channel is 1.4 mm wide (0.6 mm clearance based on larger particle diamater) to allow for excess fluid to flow through without impacting the pinched flow carrying the particles. The smaller bottom channel has a width of 0.6 mm to allow for the smaller particles will fit easily through, and the larger particles will continue their flow to the middle (0.435 mm clearance based on smaller particle diamater).
