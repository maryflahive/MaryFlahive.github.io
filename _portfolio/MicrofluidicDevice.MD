Microfluidic devices are micro systems that allow for the manipulation of small volumes of fuids so they can be analyzed. A microfluidic device is like a circuit board for liquids qhere small channels and tubes transport, sort, and mix reagants together. Key features of a microfluidic device incluide: precise fluid control, low sample volumes, and fast analysis and processing. Pinch flow sorting is a microfluidic technique used to seperate particles or cells based on their size. This method may be used for cell sorting or particle seperation. Pinch flow sorting can be challenging due to the need to maintain consistent flow stability. The channels in the microfluidic design also need to created for different particle sizes in order to control their paths. The fabrication of these devices need to be precise as small changes in dimensions can impact sorting.
