Many medical situations require a device to administer specific doses of fluids to a patient over long periods. While this would be inefficient or impractically expensive for human nurses to accomplish, syringe pumps, or infusion pumps, provide a cheap and inexpensive way to supply these doses to patients reliably in a controlled manner. The design of the pump usually consists of a syringe that holds said fluid, a block to push the syringe plunge and eject the liquid through increased pressure, a lead screw to convert a motorâ€™s rotational motion to linear movement, a base to hold the enclosure together, and fluidic tubing to transfer the liquid to the patient. This design incorporates similar components to provide the same functionality of stable and controlled pumping of fluid.

# Features

* **Massive Print Area: 1140 x 1200 x 1100 mm.** With a build envelop just shy of 4 feet in all dimensions, the LF3DP is capable of printing furniture and other large objects.
* **High Volumetric Output Extruder: 1 kg/hr - 450 C.** This printer come standard with a MDPH2 extruder by Massive Dimension, which can extrude at a rate of 1 kg/hr. Unlike typical filament extruders, the MDPH2 uses a screw to convey and liquify plastic pellets before the molten material is pushed out of a large nozzle (1 to 5 mm extrusion diameter). Please note: This printer can also be configured for other high flow rate extruders, such as the Typhoon and Pulsar by Dyze Design.
* **Affordable Pellet Feedstock** Pellets are the cheapest form of feedstock for any plastic-based manufacturing process. Save 50-75% of material costs by using pellets instead of spools of filament. Concentrated colorant can be added to the virgin material to achieve any color in the rainbow without requiring large amounts of storage. Recyled material can also be used for sustainable material printing.
