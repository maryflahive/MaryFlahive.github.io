Syringe pumps, also known as infusion pumps, offer a cost-effective solution for administering precise fluid doses to patients over extended periods, a task that would be costly and inefficient for human nurses. These pumps typically feature a syringe for fluid storage, a block to press the plunger, a lead screw to translate motor rotation into linear motion, a base for structural integrity, and tubing to deliver the fluid, ensuring consistent and controlled fluid delivery. This design incorporates similar components to provide the same functionality of stable and controlled pumping of fluid.

* **Massive Print Area: 1140 x 1200 x 1100 mm.** With a build envelop just shy of 4 feet in all dimensions, the LF3DP is capable of printing furniture and other large objects.
* **High Volumetric Output Extruder: 1 kg/hr - 450 C.** This printer come standard with a MDPH2 extruder by Massive Dimension, which can extrude at a rate of 1 kg/hr. Unlike typical filament extruders, the MDPH2 uses a screw to convey and liquify plastic pellets before the molten material is pushed out of a large nozzle (1 to 5 mm extrusion diameter). Please note: This printer can also be configured for other high flow rate extruders, such as the Typhoon and Pulsar by Dyze Design.
* **Affordable Pellet Feedstock** Pellets are the cheapest form of feedstock for any plastic-based manufacturing process. Save 50-75% of material costs by using pellets instead of spools of filament. Concentrated colorant can be added to the virgin material to achieve any color in the rainbow without requiring large amounts of storage. Recyled material can also be used for sustainable material printing.
