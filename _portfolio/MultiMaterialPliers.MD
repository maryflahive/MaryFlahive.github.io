This project's objective was to design and print needle nose pliers that can pick up through-hole resistors. These pliers will use multiple materials to include the flexibility required for a spring component that allows the pliers to return to the open position when not in use. Two options to create a multi-material print would be to print seperate pieces that fit together, or create a print-in-place model. Print-in-place models are functional multiple-component designs, that work immediately after removal from the print bed. They are created through single material extrusion from precisely designed models with the right amount of clearance between printed joints or where roattion is needed. For succesful print-in-place model results, the print settings are crucial. Different materials react differently to temperatures, so with this method the correct temperatures will produce good extrusions. Other applications for print-in-place models include robotics and mechanical systems. This method can be used to create functional components such as joints, valves, and gears. Materials such as PLA, ABS, and TPU work well for print-in-place models because of their flexibility, durability, and their ability to maintain structural integrity.

## Design
The design for these pliers includes 5 pieces: 2 handles, 2 jaw tips, and a center flexible mesh. The handles have a long and thin design to allow the user to easily grip the pliers with one hand. The jaw of the pliers have flat lines that come to a point to create a good grip. The jaw length is 50 mm and the jaw capacity is 9 mm. Both the handles and jaw tips were printed using PLA. The center mesh is printed with TPU to create a flexbile component for the pliers to function. The flexible spring component is created through the print settings for the infill. The middle mesh part is imported into SuperSlicer and rotated 45 degrees to align with the infill. The solid layes for the top and bottom are put to 0. The sparse infill patern is set to monotonic to create a square pattern. The density is set to 10% and the perimeters and 4.
