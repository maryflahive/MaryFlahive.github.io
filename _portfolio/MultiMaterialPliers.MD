This project's objective was to design and print needle nose pliers that can pick up through-hole resistors. These pliers will use multiple materials to include the flexibility required for a spring component that allows the pliers to return to the open position when not in use. Two options to create a multi-material print would be to print seperate pieces that fit together, or create a print-in-place model. Print-in-place models are functional multiple-component designs, that work immediately after removal from the print bed. They are created through single material extrusion from precisely designed models with the right amount of clearance between printed joints or where roattion is needed. For succesful print-in-place model results, the print settings are crucial. Different materials react differently to temperatures, so with this method the correct temperatures will produce good extrusions. Other applications for print-in-place models include robotics and mechanical systems. This method can be used to create functional components such as joints, valves, and gears. Materials such as PLA, ABS, and TPU work well for print-in-place models because of their flexibility, durability, and their ability to maintain structural integrity.
