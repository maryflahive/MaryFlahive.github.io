## Interference Error

After the design was printed, we tested it out on the longboard assembly. Unfortunately, this iteration contained too much material near the kingpin so it did not slide onto the assembly. Because of the angle of the kingpin and the pivot cup, there needed to be a lot of clearance to allow the hangar room to slide onto the part. To fix this, I added more obstacle geometry around the space where my printed hangar collided with the assembly. This will provide more room for the pieces to fit together. The updated design is in the above CAD models. The image below shows the failed print with the interference point circles.

## Generative Design Discussion
  The unique pairing of powder bed fusion and generative design approaches has allowed for the advancement of optimized part geometries. This combination offers many key advantages. PBF processes allow for the fabrication of parts with highly complex geometries that would be extremely difficult to create using traditional subtractive or additive manufacturing techniques. Generative design parts usually have strange, organic shapes which would also be impossible to create using traditional manufacturing methods. Therefore, the combination of the two applications allow for organic shapes and complex geometries to be created. 
  By including structural, thermal, and other relevant components into the generative design process, the resulting parts can be optimized for specific performance metrics, such as weight, stiffness, and heat transfer. This allows for the creation of parts that are customized to their intended function, instead of being limited by the constraints of traditional manufacturing processes. Additionally, PBF and generative design can produce parts with less material waste compared to traditional manufacturing methods which contributes to more sustainable manufacturing practices.
  A commercial example being explored using generative design to create more optimal parts is an automotive engine mounting bracket. This is a complex part that includes a range of requirements related to rigidity, strength, and sustainability. Through a comparative analysis between generative design and traditional design, they evaluated the weight, deformation, stress, fatigue, CO2 emissions, and self sufficiency of the two models. The generative design allowed for a 30% reduction in the weight of the part compared to the traditional design model, and its rigidity and strength were also improved. Along with engine components, generative design can be applied across a wide range of automotive parts including: body panels, frames, and suspension parts. By using generative design with additive manufacturing, automakers can create parts that are lighter, stronger, and more efficient. This is important for improving overall vehicle performance and sustainability since less weight turns into gains in fuel efficiency and electric vehicle range.

The proper application of load cases and constraints is crucial when using generative design. The generative design process will create and optimize the design based on the specified loads and constraints the user places. Various types of loads that need to be considered: force, pressure, bearing, and impact loads. Accurately inputting the magnitude, direction, and distribution of these loads is also important because incorrect load cases can lead to designs that may not meet the requirements or could be prone to failure under real-world conditions.Determining the appropriate load cases requires an understanding of the application and environment the part is meant to be in. This may include reviewing specifications, analyzing the dynamics of the part, and considering various scenarios it may be involved in to identify the loading conditions.The placement of structural constraints, such as fixing them to certain faces or edges, can also have a significant impact on the generative design outcome. Incorrect constraint placement may result in uneven load distribution or overengineering in certain areas of the part. The constraints should be placed to align with the machining directions. Consideration of the part's function, assembly, and manufacturing processes is necessary to determine the appropriate locations of the constraints.

These parts in this project were created using Fusion 360â€™s generative design tool. Two materials were used when generating outcomes: ALSi10Mg and Nylon 12. The two outcomes had similar designs yet different masses. The Aluminum part had a mass of 1.133 kg while the Nylon part had a mass of 0.433 kg. Generative design is a powerful tool that offers several benefits, but it also comes with some drawbacks that should be considered. Its capabilities can bring significant improvements to manufacturing in performance metrics such as weight, strength, and efficiency, making it valuable for applications where these factors are critical. The organic, complex shapes produced by generative design can be challenging to manufacture which limits their practical application and ability to be printed using traditional manufacturing techniques such as filament and resin printing. Also, accurately predicting the cost and manufacturability of generativity designed parts requires advanced cost modeling capabilities. The "garbage in, garbage out" principle ensures that the quality of the generative design output is very dependent on the accuracy of the input parameters, such as load cases and boundary conditions. These numbers can be difficult to correctly compute for a component with a lot of factors in its environment. Creating a generative design model is time consuming, and the process is not sped up because the user is not manually creating the part. Creating the preserve geometry and obstacle geometry takes time along with a lot of trial and error. The process of generating a design from the geometry the user creates can also take up to several hours depending on the complexity of the part. The most useful applications of generative design are found in industries where weight reduction and optimization of critical components are very important, such as aerospace and automotive. It is also useful in medical devices, where patient-specific implants and prosthetics can benefit from generative design and additive manufacturing.
