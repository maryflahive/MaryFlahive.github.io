## Interference Error

After the design was printed, we tested it out on the longboard assembly. Unfortunately, this iteration contained too much material near the kingpin so it did not slide onto the assembly. Because of the angle of the kingpin and the pivot cup, there needed to be a lot of clearance to allow the hangar room to slide onto the part. To fix this, I added more obstacle geometry around the space where my printed hangar collided with the assembly. This will provide more room for the pieces to fit together. The updated design is in the above CAD models. The image below shows the failed print with the interference point circles. 

## Generative Design Discussion
  The unique pairing of powder bed fusion and generative design approaches has allowed for the advancement of optimized part geometries. This combination offers many key advantages. PBF processes allow for the fabrication of parts with highly complex geometries that would be extremely difficult to create using traditional subtractive or additive manufacturing techniques. Generative design parts usually have strange, organic shapes which would also be impossible to create using traditional manufacturing methods. Therefore, the combination of the two applications allow for organic shapes and complex geometries to be created. 
  By including structural, thermal, and other relevant components into the generative design process, the resulting parts can be optimized for specific performance metrics, such as weight, stiffness, and heat transfer. This allows for the creation of parts that are customized to their intended function, instead of being limited by the constraints of traditional manufacturing processes. Additionally, PBF and generative design can produce parts with less material waste compared to traditional manufacturing methods which contributes to more sustainable manufacturing practices.
  A commercial example being explored using generative design to create more optimal parts is an automotive engine mounting bracket. This is a complex part that includes a range of requirements related to rigidity, strength, and sustainability. Through a comparative analysis between generative design and traditional design, they evaluated the weight, deformation, stress, fatigue, CO2 emissions, and self sufficiency of the two models. The generative design allowed for a 30% reduction in the weight of the part compared to the traditional design model, and its rigidity and strength were also improved. Along with engine components, generative design can be applied across a wide range of automotive parts including: body panels, frames, and suspension parts. By using generative design with additive manufacturing, automakers can create parts that are lighter, stronger, and more efficient. This is important for improving overall vehicle performance and sustainability since less weight turns into gains in fuel efficiency and electric vehicle range.
